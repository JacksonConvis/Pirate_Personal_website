    <p> Yes, that is a hornpipe in my pocket and I am happy to see you. That’s quite a cutlass ye got thar, what ye need is a good scabbard! Drink up me hearties yoho …a pirates life for me STOP BLOWING HOLES IN MY SHIP!!! Even pirates, before they attack another ship, hoist a black flag. The existence of the sea means the existence of pirates. Damnation seize my soul if I give you quarters, or take any from you. It is when pirates count their booty that they become mere thieves. Whats a pirate’s favorite fast food restaurant?  Arrrrbys! Piracy – Hostile take over.

        Ya know, darlin’, I’m 97 percent chum free Brwaack! Polly want a cracker? … Oh, wait. That’s for Talk Like a PARROT Day. So, tell me, why do they call ye, “Cap’n Feathersword?” Give me freedom or give me the rope. For I shall not take the shackles that subjugate the poor to uphold the rich. Now and then we had a hope that if we lived and were good, God would permit us to be pirates. Life’s pretty good, and why wouldn’t it be? I’m a pirate, after all. The Code is more like guidelines, really. Ahoy! lets trouble the water!
       
       What are YOU doing here? So, tell me, why do they call ye, “Cap’n Feathersword?” Me I’m Dishonest. And A Dishonest Man You Can Always Trust To Be Dishonest. Honestly Its The Honest Ones You Want To Watch Out For Because You Never Know When They Are Going To Do Something Completely Stupid! The rougher the seas, the smoother we sail. Ahoy! If ye thinks he be ready to sail a beauty, ye better be willin’ to sink with her.
       
       Pardon me, but would ya mind if I fired me cannon through your porthole? Why are pirates pirates? cuz they arrrrrr The Code is more like guidelines, really. Damnation seize my soul if I give you quarters, or take any from you. Well actualy piracy is a democracy with captains voted for by the crew.</p>

    <p> Where there is a sea there are pirates.

        C’mon, lad, shiver me timbers! Take what you can, give nothing back The rougher the seas, the smoother we sail. Ahoy! How much does the pirate pay for an ear piercing? … A buccaneer! (buck- in- ear…) My mom would not let me see the pirate movie because it was rated rrrrr.
        
        Well blow me down? Me I’m Dishonest. And A Dishonest Man You Can Always Trust To Be Dishonest. Honestly Its The Honest Ones You Want To Watch Out For Because You Never Know When They Are Going To Do Something Completely Stupid! If ye can’t trust a pirate, ye damn well can’t trust a merchant either! Give me freedom or give me the rope. For I shall not take the shackles that subjugate the poor to uphold the rich. To err is human but to arr is pirate!! The Code is more like guidelines, really. Merchant and pirate were for a long period one and the same person. Even today mercantile morality is really nothing but a refinement of piratical morality. Damnation seize my soul if I give you quarters, or take any from you. Without the messy paperwork.

        That’s the finest pirate booty I’ve ever laid eyes on. Not all treasure is silver and gold Always be yourself, unless you can be a pirate. Then always be a pirate. you know, thats the 2nd time I’v watched that man sail away with my ship. Damnation seize my soul if I give you quarters, or take any from you.

You’re drinking a Salty Dog? How’d you like to try the real thing? The Code is more like guidelines, really. Pirate’s code: First freedom and the captain. Second the loot, third woman and the rum and at the end no mercy if they not immediately surrender! How much does the pirate pay for an ear piercing? … A buccaneer! (buck- in- ear…)

Brwaack! Polly want a cracker? … Oh, wait. That’s for Talk Like a PARROT Day. That’s quite a cutlass ye got thar, what ye need is a good scabbard! C’mon, lad, shiver me timbers! Why is the rum gone? You will always remember this as the day you almost caught Captain Jack Sparrow. But I am touched by y’loyalty mate. Land was created to provide a place for boats to visit.

I’d love to drop anchor in your lagoon. Well blow me down? You can always trust the untrustworthy because you can always trust that they will be untrustworthy. Its the trustworthy you can’t trust. Suddenly you’re like a pirate, you’re 65 years old and you’ve got an ear- ring. You will always remember this as the day you almost caught Captain Jack Sparrow. Shiver me timbers.
